    "Jam used to use `jam.json` instead of `package.json`, until [July 2012](https://github.com/caolan/jam/commit/7242669b1fe6dec5a3830540363f14a0a60c67c8)",
    "Jam can also be detected by using the `jam` property in a project's `package.json`",
    "The install path for Jam can be customised in the project's `package.json`, by setting `jam.packageDir` to something other than `./jam`."
